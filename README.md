### 👋 Hello, World! I'm Juliana Zambon

I am a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Paraná, actively participating in PET Computação projects and volunteering at the Vision, Robotics, and Image Lab, developing educational applications. I support children's rights through UNICEF Brazil and, in 2024, have coordinated communications for Latin America's largest women's programming marathon (MFP). In 2023, I published a paper titled 'Technology as an Agent of Inclusion: The Impact of the Computer Training Course for Immigrants.' I have advanced knowledge of English and basic knowledge of Spanish and German. Additionally, I am an ICPC competitor, participating in programming marathons, and part of the Brazilian Alumni of Aspire Institute.
