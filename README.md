### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World! I'm Juliana Zambon

I am a Computer Science student at UFPR, passionate about using technology as a tool to create innovative solutions with a positive social impact. Currently, I work as a researcher at the Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software (C3SL) within UFPRâ€™s Department of Informatics, and I am involved in undergraduate research at the Vision, Robotics, and Imaging Laboratory (VRI), where I have contributed to the development of the PICCE platform.

I am deeply committed to promoting female inclusion in technology. In 2024, I took on the role of Communications Coordinator for the Womenâ€™s Programming Marathon (MFP) and actively compete in programming contests, environments that challenge my ability to work under pressure, optimize solutions, and collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.

I am a member of the Brazilian alumni network of the Aspire Institute, where I developed skills in leadership, innovation, and community impact, while connecting with a global community of professionals and entrepreneurs. Additionally, I volunteered digitally with #tmjUNICEF, focusing on advocating for the rights of children and adolescents, especially regarding mental health issues.
