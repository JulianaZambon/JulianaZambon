### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World! I'm Juliana Zambon

I'm a Computer Science student at the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (UFPR), passionate about using technology to build innovative solutions that create a positive social impact.

Currently, I work as a researcher at the Vision, Robotics, and Image Lab (VRI), where I help develop the educational app CiÃªncia na Escola and explore the exciting intersection of computing and genetics. Previously, I was a scholarship holder in the Tutorial Education Program (PET) in Computer Science.

I'm committed to female inclusion in tech. In 2024, I became the Communications Coordinator for the Womenâ€™s Programming Marathon (MFP) â€” the largest women's programming marathon in Latin America. Iâ€™m also an active competitive programmer, constantly improving my problem-solving and teamwork skills through challenges under pressure.

Iâ€™m part of the Aspire Institute's Brazilian alumni network, where I developed leadership, innovation, and community impact skills while connecting with a global community of changemakers.

I also volunteered digitally with #tmjUNICEF, supporting the defense of childrenâ€™s and adolescentsâ€™ rights in Brazil, with a special focus on mental health.
